        Increasing green spaces in urban areas improves health, mental wellness,
        <br>air quality, and provides a place for community to gather. However,
        <br>many studies show that the development and distribution of these spaces
        <br>is disproportionate and often benefits predominately White and/or more
        <br>affluent communities, creating environmental justice issues.</p>
