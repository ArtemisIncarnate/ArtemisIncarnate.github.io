        <b><u>URBAN PARKS AND GREENSPACES</u>
        <br>Increasing green spaces in urban areas improves health, mental wellness,
        <br>air quality, and provides a place for community to gather. However,
        <br>many studies show that the development and distribution of these spaces
        <br>is disproportionate and often benefits predominately White and/or more
        <br>affluent communities, creating environmental justice issues.</b></p>

          <br>BREC's mission is to contribute to a healthier, more vibrant community
          <br>by providing exceptional parks, open spaces and recreational experiences
          <br>for all of East Baton Rouge Parish.
          <br>
          <br>BREC's vision is to provide an extraordinary system of parks, open spaces,
          <br>and facilities that engages the Parish's unique natural and cultural landscape
          <br>to enrich Parish life by providing diverse and memorable recreation experience.
          <br>
          <br>BREC has more than 180 parks including a unique mix of facilities, which
          <br>mirror the history and rich natural resources in the region; including a
          <br>state-of-the-art observatory, a swamp nature center and conservation areas,
          <br>a performing arts theatre, an equestrian park, an art gallery, an arboretum,
          <br>an accredited zoo, seven golf courses and an extreme sports park with a 30,000-foot
          <br>concrete skate park, rock-climbing wall, BMX track and velodrome.
          <br>
          <br>Since 2004, BREC has constructed twelve community parks, five dog parks, a
          <br>family-sized Aquatics Center, a growing trails system, fishing ponds,
          <br>larger playgrounds and procured two mobile recreation units to serve play
          <br>deserts in the area.

          Though parks and public spaces should be easily accessible by all community
          <br> members, studies suggest urban greenspaces tend to imporve predominantly
          <br>White neighborhoods. As a predominantly Black and White community, segregated
          <br>by socioeconomic factors, it is important that the tax-payer-supported
          <br>BREC centers and facilities be distributed equiably to aviod environmental
          <br> justice issues and gentrification.
          <br>
          <br>Public transportation infrastructure in Baton Rouge is not easily or equitably
          <br>accessed for all persons in all areas. Unfortunately, not all BREC parks are
          <br>along easy bus routes. For lower income groups who are dependent on the bus
          <br>system to enjoy BREC facilities, it is necessary that BREC parks are either
          <br>on a direct bus line or a walkable distance.
          <br>
          <br>By using the web map and applications, users and client editors can determine
          <br>the level of access to BREC facilities for community members from all
          <br>socioeconomic groups and ethinicities. Editors can analyze data pulled from
          <br>embedded map/app layers by joining attributes and searching for the nearest
          <br>facilities.This information can be used by client editors to propose new
          <br>bus routes and times, additional greentrails, improve planning, and
          <br>inform policy.</p>
