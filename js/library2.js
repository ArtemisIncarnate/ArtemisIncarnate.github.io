// this library is for notes taking
// <script src = "js/library2.js"></script>
// this will become a library of code. This is referring to a bunch of functions or
// classes that can be used for something else.
// this library file (used for the portfolio page) saves one from having to write their
// own code. We can use the on-file library codes to reference and use a code that has
// already been made.
// Library is a collection of code around a certain theme. (i.e. a mapping library for ArcGIS)

// jQuery code - way of doing something after it has already been run and waiting for it to load again
// $(document).ready(console.lof('The page is ready'))  // this is not built into Javascript. It is built into our jQuery library
